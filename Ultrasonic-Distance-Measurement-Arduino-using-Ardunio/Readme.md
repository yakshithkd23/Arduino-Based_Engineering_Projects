This ultrasonic sensor module can be used for measuring distance, object sensor, motion sensors etc. High sensitive module can be used with microcontroller to integrate with motion circuits to make robotic projects and other distance, position & motion sensitive products.
The module sends eight 40Khz square wave pulses and automatically detects whether it receives the returning signal. If there is a signal returning,  a high level pulse is sent on the echo pin. The length of this pulse is the time it took the signal from first triggering to the return echo.

✅ 1. Generates Clock Signal
Microcontrollers (like ATmega328 on Arduino Uno) need a clock to execute instructions in a timed manner.

The ceramic resonator provides that steady clock signal (e.g., 16 MHz for Arduino Uno).

✅ 2. Enables Accurate Timing
Functions like delay(), millis(), micros(), pulseIn(), and communication protocols like Serial, I2C, and SPI depend on accurate timing.

A resonator ensures the Arduino runs at the expected speed.

✅ 3. Smaller and Cheaper than Crystal Oscillators
Ceramic resonators are more compact and cost-effective than quartz crystals.

They are good enough for general applications (like blinking LEDs, basic sensors, serial communication, etc.).
